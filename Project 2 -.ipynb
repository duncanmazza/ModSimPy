    "The phenomenon in question is a universal one - one that anyone who consumes hot beverages experiences on a regular occurrence: As a hot drink is being consumed, the liquid loses heat faster as less volume remains. The resulting experience is a drink that grows colder faster the more rapidly it is consumed. Thus, we set out to answer the questions: \n",
    "1. How can this relationship between changing volume and changing rate of temperature drop be qualitatively explained?\n",
    "2. Can we predict the final temperature of a fluid at a given time based on its starting temperature, the temperature of its environment, the heat transfer coefficient specific to its container, the dimensions of the container (a rectangular prism with a square base), and its rate of change of volume (assumed to be constant)?"

    "To answer these questions, we start with $dTdt = -r * (T - T_{env})$ where $T_{env}$ is the temperature of the environment, and $r$ is a constant that represents: $(h*A)/(C*m)$ where $h$ is the heat transfer coefficient, $A$ is the surface area of convection, $C$ is the specific heat of water, and $m$ is the mass of the water. Thus, $r$ can be represented as a function of the volume of water. The following assumptions are made in our model: \n",
    "1. The heat transfer is assumed to be constant over all surfaces of the container, which in the physical world isn't true. The heat transfer coefficient is different depending on whether the water is in contact with the air or with the walls of the container. Because the container we are modeling is a plastic container and therefore of low conductivity, we believe this is negligible. \n",
    "2. Because the dimensions of the container must be defined to avoid a two-dimensional function, we reference the container used in the later experiment: a 0.13m x 0.13m x 0.05m plastic container.\n",
    "3. Because the heat transfer constant is an empirically determined value, we chose the value of `h = 0.09` to match our mathematical model as close as possible to our empirical model (seen later in the essay). \n",
    "While this is an empirically-driven mathematical model, these values must be measured to achieve a two-dimensional result. Thus, our results are constrained to interpretation only in the context of our specific container, but the model is flexible enough to accommodate any container so long as the empirical information is supplied.\n",

    "This graph illustrates that, given enough parameters/information about a specific container, the final temperature can be predicted based on the rate of change of volume of the container. A minimum is expected to occur at approximately $dVdt$ = -2 because that indicates a cusp at which the container will either have zero or nonzero volume remaining (to the right and left of the cusp respectively). However, the graph is likely inaccurate because it exhibits an odd behavior: a local minimum and maximum occur between -4 < $dVdt$ < -3. There is no reason to suggest that this phenomenon should occur, as the relationship between volume and r does not exhibit any inflection points. A likely explanation for this shortcoming is the infinite slopes that exist in the temperature vs. time graphs when volume approaches 0, which may result in inaccurate readings at the extremities of the graphs. This mathematical model will be further analyzed in comparison to the following empirical model.    "

    "It is clear that the mathematical model and empirical model, while sharing common features such as being (mostly) concave and having a cusp at -2 < $dVdt$ < -1, deviate in a few key ways:\n",
    "1. The empirical model does not return a graph that contains more than one maximum point\n",
    "2. The mathematical model predicts in at least one scenario a final temperature of â25Â°C, whereas the empirical model predicts a lowest temperature of â33Â°C. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the mathematical model may predict a near-infinite $dTdt$ at $V$ â 0 (and therefore a result such as room temperature water when $dVdt$ â1.88 mL/sec), the empirical model shows that, in reality, this is not reasonable. This, too, is backed up by our intuition, which would suggest that liquids do not suddenly become room temperature when $V$ â 0 even if their volume is decreasing. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the assumptions that we included in our model, we were still able to successfully show the mathematical relationship between decreasing $dTdt$ and $dVdt$ of a fluid in an open vessel. In other words, we have explained the phenomenon of coffee cooling faster as it is consumed. Although the mathematical model produces a less-desireable result than the empirical model, given enough parameters, we are able to predict the final temperature of the fluid for a variety of $dVdt$ values. Furthermore, if a minimum acceptable temperature is desired for the water, the $dVdt$ values necessary to produce this temperature or greater can be delineated by the horizontal lines on fig. 3 and fig. 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If this model's scope were to be extended, further steps could be taken to more accurately represent mathematically the heat transfer of the system. For example, consideration of the differences in convection between the walls of the container and the air could be added to the model. There could be additional exploration of the insulating properties of other containers and how these differences affect the results of the model. Another addition to this model could be the use of a piecewise function of $dVdt$, simulating more realistically how a person would consume a hot beverage in sips as opposed to a constant volume change.\n",
    "\n",
    "A relationship to note among the qualitative results: By the argument that there is a point of inflection where the cooling curve created by $dTdt$ over time changes from concave to convex, there must be a value of $dVdt$ for which the curve of $dTdt$ is an entirely linear relationship. Further expansion of this model could look into this relationship, optimizing $dVdt$ such that cooling could be a perfectly linear process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iteration of model:\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was initially running off of an empirical relationship between $r$ and $V$. Thus, it was not actually a model in the sense of it being completely mathematically based. Upon realization of this shortcoming, we added in a mathematical relationship relationship between $r$ and $V$, and then ran the model on both functions independently to compare the results. Another iteration that was made was adding in a quantitative analysis of the qualitative results. As eye-catching as the qualitative results are with their dovetail pattern of curves, they are not the punchline graphs we need. Therefore, we added in code that extracted data from these qualitative results to provide the punchline graphs of fig. 3 and fig. 7, a more easily interpretable result, and a clear answer to our second question.
