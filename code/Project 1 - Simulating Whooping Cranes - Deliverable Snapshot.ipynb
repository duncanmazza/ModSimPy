    "We live in a time of decreasing bio-diversity and increasing numbers of endangered species. When taking conservational measures with a species, it is important to make predictions about the future of the species. Existing metrics for this exist - notably, the MVP, or minimum viable population. The minimum viable population (specifically the MVPa metric) refers to, \"A is the minimum viable adult population size as estimated from the available data regardless of study length,\" according to the paper cited at the end of the essay. \n",

Essentially, can we expect that the population will reach a minimum threshold for survivability within the next 20 years? \n",

We used the population of 150 from 1995 and the population of 450 from 2015 to obtain a grwoth of 300 cranes over the last 20 years. Fit to an exponential model (which the population graph follows), the year-over-year growth rate was approximately 5.65%:\n"
